			<h1>Project Sekai: Colorful Stage</h1>
			
			<p>
			   The game is set in Shibuya, Tokyo. A girl named Hoshino Ichika walks through the streets and she sees an LCD screen displaying Hatsune Miku.
               Upon returning home, she discovers a song named "Untitled" on her smartphone. Out of curiously, Ichika plays the songs, only to get surrounded 
			   by a white light and arrive at an unknown place. Hatsune Miku stands in front of Ichika, welcoming her to Sekai and inviting her to sing together.
